        <p style="color: blue; text-align:center;">Born and raised in a Hindu family </p><p>in coastal Gujarat,
         Gandhi trained in the law at the Inner Temple, London, 
         and was called to the bar at age 22 in June 1891. </p>

         <p style="color: yellow;"> After two uncertain years in India, where he was 
        unable to start a successful law practice, he moved to
        <span style="border:1px solid green;"> india is my country</span>South Africa in 1893 to represent an Indian merchant 
        in a lawsuit. He went on to live in South Africa for
           21 years. It was here that Gandhi raised a family and 
           first employed nonviolent resistance in a campaign for
            civil rights. In 1915, aged 45, he returned to India 
            and soon set about organising peasants, farmers, and
             urban labourers to protest against excessive land-tax 
             and discrimination. </p>
